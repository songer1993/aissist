# todo-management Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-todo-management. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Add Todos
The system SHALL allow users to add todos to dated Markdown files with optional goal linking.

#### Scenario: Add todo with text
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo add "Review PR #123"`
- **THEN** the system appends the todo to `todos/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with a checkbox format `- [ ] Review PR #123`
- **AND** the todo is timestamped with HH:MM format

#### Scenario: Add todo with goal keyword
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo add "Review PR #123" --goal "review"`
- **THEN** the system performs keyword matching against active goals
- **AND** links to the matching goal if exactly one match is found
- **AND** stores the goal metadata inline: `- [ ] Review PR #123 (Goal: review-code-quality)`

#### Scenario: Add todo with --date flag
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo add "Call dentist" --date 2025-11-05`
- **THEN** the system appends the todo to `todos/2025-11-05.md` instead of today's file
- **AND** validates the date format before proceeding

### Requirement: List Todos
The system SHALL allow users to view and interact with todos through a checkbox interface, defaulting to all incomplete todos across all dates when no date filter is specified, and supporting natural language date expressions.

**Changes**: Updated default behavior to show all incomplete todos (not just today's), and added natural language date support for the `--date` flag to match behavior of other commands like `history`.

#### Scenario: List all incomplete todos by default
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo list` without any flags
- **THEN** the system displays all incomplete todos from all dates
- **AND** sorts todos by priority (descending) then by date (ascending)
- **AND** displays each todo with its date: `YYYY-MM-DD | Priority | Todo text`
- **AND** allows the user to select multiple todos to mark as complete
- **AND** updates the correct date-specific file when todos are completed

#### Scenario: List todos interactively
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo list`
- **THEN** the system displays all incomplete todos across all dates with checkbox UI
- **AND** allows the user to select multiple todos to mark as complete
- **AND** updates the todo file for the correct date with checkmarks: `- [x] Task`
- **AND** logs each completed todo to `history/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timestamp and context

- **AND** shows interactive or plain mode based on flags
- **AND** validates the ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Scenario: List todos for specific date (natural language)
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo list --date yesterday`
- **THEN** the system parses "yesterday" to the appropriate date using `parseNaturalDate`
- **AND** displays todos from that specific date
- **AND** shows interactive or plain mode based on flags

#### Scenario: List todos for timeframe (natural language)
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo list --date "this week"`
- **THEN** the system parses "this week" to a date range
- **AND** displays all incomplete todos within that date range
- **AND** sorts by priority then by date
- **AND** includes date labels for each todo

#### Scenario: Invalid date format
- **WHEN** the user provides an invalid date format (e.g., `--date "invalid"`)
- **THEN** the system displays an error message explaining the format
- **AND** suggests valid formats: YYYY-MM-DD or natural language like "today", "yesterday", "this week"

- **AND** shows todos from all dates by default

#### Scenario: No todos found
- **WHEN** no incomplete todos exist
- **THEN** the system displays: "No incomplete todos found"
- **OR** when filtering by date: "No todos found for YYYY-MM-DD"

### Requirement: Complete Todos
The system SHALL allow users to mark todos as completed and log them to history automatically.

#### Scenario: Complete todo by index
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo done 1`
- **THEN** the system marks the first incomplete todo as complete: `- [x] Task`
- **AND** logs the completed todo to `history/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timestamp
- **AND** includes the linked goal if present: "Goal: goal-codename"
- **AND** adds context: "Completed from TODO"

#### Scenario: Complete todo by text match
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo done "Review PR"`
- **THEN** the system finds the first todo matching the text substring
- **AND** marks it as complete and logs to history
- **AND** displays: "Todo completed: Review PR #123"

#### Scenario: Complete todo with goal

- **AND** the date is visually distinct (e.g., colored or separated)
- **AND** helps users identify when todos were created

### Requirement: Natural Language Date Parsing for Todos
The system SHALL parse natural language date expressions for the `--date` flag using the same `parseNaturalDate` utility as other commands.

#### Scenario: Common natural language dates

- **WHEN** the user uses timeframes like "this week", "last week", "this month"
- **THEN** the system resolves them to date ranges
- **AND** displays all todos within that range
- **AND** sorts by priority then date

#### Scenario: Fallback to ISO format
- **WHEN** natural language parsing fails
- **AND** the input matches ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **THEN** the system uses the ISO date
- **AND** displays todos for that date

#### Scenario: Both parsing methods fail
- **WHEN** neither natural language nor ISO format parsing succeeds
- **THEN** the system displays: "Invalid date format: [input]"
- **AND** suggests: "Use YYYY-MM-DD format or natural language like 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'"
