## Description (Full)

```
I tracked my work, fitness, and creative goals for an entire year using Aissist, a local-first AI assistant. At the end of the year, I asked it for a review... and got my personal highlight reel in 5 seconds. 🚀

In this demo:
✅ Multi-context goal tracking (work, fitness, personal projects)
✅ AI-powered semantic search across all your memories
✅ Instant year-in-review report generation
✅ 100% local, private, human-readable Markdown files
✅ No cloud, no subscriptions, no data mining

Unlike productivity apps that lock your data in proprietary formats, Aissist stores everything as Markdown files on your machine. Your data, your rules, forever.

Text (optional comment):
Hey HN! I built Aissist to solve my own problem: I kept forgetting my accomplishments during performance reviews.

After a year of tracking work, fitness, and personal projects, I asked it for a year-in-review. Got a polished summary in 5 seconds.

Key design decisions:
- Local-first: All data in Markdown files on your machine
- Multi-context: Work, fitness, personal projects in separate spaces
- AI-powered: Claude Code integration for semantic search
- Git-friendly: Human-readable storage, perfect for version control

Demo shows the full workflow. Built with TypeScript, uses VHS for terminal recording.

Would love feedback on the AI integration approach – it uses Claude's file analysis tools for semantic recall without sending data to APIs.
