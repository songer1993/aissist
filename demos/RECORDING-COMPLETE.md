## Re-Recording Instructions

   ```

2. **Re-run Recording**

## Troubleshooting

### GIF Won't Play on GitHub
- **Cause**: File size too large or format issue
- **Fix**: Already optimized at 2.2MB (should work)
- **Alternative**: Use `gifsicle -O3` if needed

### Demo Looks Blurry
- **Cause**: Screen resolution or font size
- **Fix**: VHS tape uses Monaco 14pt at 1200x600 (optimal)

### Commands Fail During Recording
- **Cause**: Aissist CLI not linked or mock data missing
- **Fix**: See QUICK-START-RECORDING.md for setup steps
