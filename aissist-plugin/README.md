# Aissist Plugin for Claude Code

**Connect your past, present, and future in Markdown—right inside Claude Code.**

The Aissist Plugin provides seamless integration between aissist's timeline-connected memory system and your Claude Code workflow. Track what you've done, manage what you're doing, and plan where you're going without leaving your AI coding assistant.

## Overview

Aissist works natively with Claude Code through intelligent slash commands and automatic skill activation. It brings goal tracking, history logging, semantic recall, and AI-powered planning directly into your conversations—all stored in portable Markdown files.

### Key Features

- **AI-Enhanced Logging**: Log work with automatic enhancement and goal linking
- **GitHub Integration**: Import commits and PRs as history entries
- **Semantic Recall**: Search your history with natural language queries
- **Accomplishment Reports**: Generate reports for standups, reviews, and more
- **Skill Activation**: Automatic aissist CLI integration when you mention goals or todos
- **Multimodal Support**: Log work with screenshots and images
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Access goals and data from parent directories (perfect for monorepos)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Aissist CLI** must be installed and initialized:
   ```bash
   npm install -g aissist
   aissist init --global
   ```

2. **Claude Code** must be installed and authenticated:
   ```bash
   claude login
   ```

### Install Plugin

#### Production (Recommended)

Install from the GitHub marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add albertnahas/aissist
claude plugin install aissist
```

#### Development (Local)

For plugin development or testing:

```bash
# From the aissist project root
claude plugin marketplace add ./aissist-plugin
claude plugin install aissist
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude plugin list
```

You should see `aissist` in the list of installed plugins.

## Quick Start

### Slash Commands

Use these commands directly in Claude Code conversations:

```

## Aissist CLI Skill

The plugin includes the `aissist-cli` skill that provides comprehensive CLI access within Claude Code conversations.

**When It Activates:**

The skill automatically activates when you mention:
- Goals or goal tracking
- Tasks, todos, or task management
- Progress tracking or accomplishments
- Daily logging or journaling
- Work history or activity tracking
- Context-specific notes (work, fitness, meals)
- Reflections or reviews

**What It Provides:**

Full access to aissist CLI commands:
```bash
aissist goal add "Learn Rust"
aissist todo add "Review PR #123"
aissist history log "Completed auth implementation"
aissist context log work "Sprint planning notes"
aissist reflect
```

**Example Activation:**

```
You: "I want to track my progress on learning TypeScript"
Claude: [aissist-cli skill activates]
         Let me help you set that up as a goal...
         [runs: aissist goal add "Learn TypeScript"]
```

See [skills/aissist-cli/SKILL.md](./skills/aissist-cli/SKILL.md) for complete documentation.

## Hooks

The plugin includes hooks that enhance Claude Code sessions with useful context.

### DateTime Context Hook

Automatically injects the current date and time into every Claude Code session. This helps Claude understand:
- Relative time references ("today", "this week", "due tomorrow")
- Deadline urgency
- Historical context for entries

The hook triggers on every `UserPromptSubmit` event and outputs:
```
Current date and time: 2025-12-07 10:15:30 CET
```

### Context Injection Hook

Injects active goals and recent history at session start, giving Claude immediate awareness of your current priorities. **Disabled by default** to avoid noise.

**Enable/Disable:**
```bash
aissist config context-injection enable   # Turn on
aissist config context-injection disable  # Turn off
aissist config context-injection status   # Check status
```

For complete `config` command documentation, see [Command Reference - config](./skills/aissist-cli/command-reference.md#config).

When enabled, the hook triggers on `SessionStart` and outputs:
```
Active context:

Goals:
  • complete-mvp (due: 2025-12-10)
  • learn-rust (ongoing)

Recent history (last 3 days):
  • [2025-12-07] Fixed authentication bug
  • [2025-12-06] Deployed v1.2 to production
```

**Benefits:**
- Claude understands your current priorities without asking
- Provides continuity between sessions
- Helps with deadline awareness and planning

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Found

If Claude Code doesn't recognize aissist commands:

1. Verify plugin installation:
   ```bash
   claude plugin list
   ```

2. If not installed, add the marketplace and install:
   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add albertnahas/aissist

   ```

3. Restart Claude Code if necessary

### Aissist CLI Not Found

If commands fail with "aissist: command not found":

1. Verify aissist CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   aissist --version
   ```

2. If not installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g aissist
   aissist init --global
   ```

### Commands Not Working

If slash commands execute but fail:

1. Check aissist is initialized:
   ```bash
   aissist path
   ```

2. Initialize if needed:
   ```bash
   aissist init --global
   ```

3. Verify Claude Code authentication:
   ```bash
