# Aissist CLI - Personal AI Assistant

Aissist is a local-first CLI personal assistant that helps users track goals, manage todos, log daily activities, organize context-specific information, and search their data using AI-powered semantic recall.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users:
- Want to **set or track goals** ("I want to learn Rust", "track my fitness goals")
- Need **todo/task management** ("add this to my todo list", "what's on my plate today")
- Want to **log their work or activities** ("record what I did today", "log this accomplishment")
- Organize **context-specific information** (work notes, meal plans, fitness logs, project details)
- Need **guided reflection** ("reflect on my week", "journal about today")
- Want to **search past activities** ("what did I work on last month", "find when I learned about X")
- Ask for **action proposals** based on their goals and history

## Quick Start

### Initialization
Before using aissist, storage must be initialized:

```bash
# Local storage (project-specific in ./.aissist/)
aissist init

# Global storage (user-wide in ~/.aissist/)
aissist init --global
```

**When to use which:**
- **Local**: Project-specific goals and todos (e.g., software project tasks)
- **Global**: Personal life goals, general todos, daily reflections

## Core Commands

### Goal Management

```bash
# Add a new goal (AI generates a memorable codename)
aissist goal add "Learn TypeScript fundamentals"

# Add goal with deadline
aissist goal add "Complete project proposal" --deadline "next Friday"

# List goals interactively (checkbox UI)
aissist goal list

# List goals in plain text
aissist goal list --plain

# Complete a goal
aissist goal complete <codename>

# Set/update deadline
aissist goal deadline <codename> "2024-12-31"
```

**Goal Features:**
- Auto-generated kebab-case codenames (e.g., "learn-typescript-fundamentals")
- Deadline support with natural language parsing
- Interactive management with checkbox UI
- Priority tracking (high/normal/low)

### Todo Management

```bash
# Add a todo
aissist todo add "Review PR #123"

# Add todo with priority
aissist todo add "Fix critical bug" --priority high

# Add todo linked to a goal
aissist todo add "Read TypeScript docs" --goal learn-typescript-fundamentals

# List todos interactively
aissist todo list

# Mark todo as done (logs to history automatically)
aissist todo done "Review PR"

# Interactive management (full CRUD)
aissist todo manage
```

**Todo Features:**
- Priority levels (high/normal/low)
- Link to goals for tracking progress
- Interactive checkbox UI
- Automatic history logging when completed

### History Logging

```bash
# Log an entry
aissist history log "Completed code review for authentication feature"

# Log with goal linking
aissist history log "Finished TypeScript tutorial chapter 3" --goal learn-typescript-fundamentals

# Import from GitHub
aissist history log --from github

# Show recent history
aissist history show

# Show history for specific timeframe
aissist history show --from "last week"
```

**History Features:**
- Daily markdown files (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Goal linking for progress tracking
- GitHub import (requires gh CLI)
- Timestamped entries

### Context Management

Organize information by context (work, diet, fitness, projects, etc.):

```bash
# Log context-specific information
aissist context log work "Sprint planning notes: focus on auth module"
aissist context log diet "Meal prep: chicken, rice, vegetables"
aissist context log fitness "Workout: 5k run in 28 minutes"

# Show context entries
aissist context show work --from "this week"

# List all contexts
aissist context list

# Bulk import files
aissist context ingest work ./meeting-notes/
```

### Reflection

Guided reflection with AI-powered prompts:

```bash
# Start interactive reflection
aissist reflect

# Reflect on specific timeframe
aissist reflect --from "this week"
```

### AI-Powered Features

```bash
# Semantic search across all data
aissist recall "what did I learn about TypeScript?"
aissist recall "show my progress on fitness goals"

# Generate action proposals
aissist propose
aissist propose "this week"
```

## Command Construction Guidelines

1. **Always check if storage is initialized** - If user is new to aissist, suggest `aissist init` first
2. **Use goal codenames for linking** - When linking to goals, use the kebab-case codename
3. **Natural language deadlines** - Aissist parses "next Friday", "end of month", "2024-12-31"
4. **Interactive when appropriate** - Suggest `list` or `manage` commands for better UX over plain text
5. **Link related data** - When logging history or todos, link to relevant goals using `--goal`

## Progressive Disclosure

For detailed information, reference these supporting files:
- **command-reference.md** - Complete command documentation with all options
- **workflow-examples.md** - Multi-step workflows and usage patterns
- **storage-model.md** - Storage concepts and file organization

## Common Patterns

**Morning Routine:**
```bash
aissist todo list  # Review today's tasks
```

**Evening Routine:**
```bash
aissist history log "Completed X, Y, and Z today"
aissist todo done "task description"  # Marks done and logs to history
```

**Goal Progress:**
```bash
aissist goal list  # Review goals
aissist history show --from "this week"  # See recent progress
aissist recall "progress on <goal>"  # AI-powered progress review
```

**Weekly Planning:**
```bash
aissist reflect --from "this week"  # Reflect on the week
aissist propose  # Get AI-generated action proposals
```

## Error Handling

If commands fail:
- Check if storage is initialized: `aissist path` shows current storage location
- Verify goal codenames with: `aissist goal list --plain`
- For recall/propose, ensure Claude API key is configured: `claude login`

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Consistent logging** - Encourage users to log daily for better recall
2. **Goal linking** - Always link todos and history to goals for progress tracking
3. **Use contexts** - Separate work, personal, fitness, etc. for better organization
4. **Weekly reflection** - Suggest regular reflection for self-awareness
5. **Leverage recall** - Use semantic search instead of manually browsing files
